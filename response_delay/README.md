# Fetching multiple urls and dynamically waiting between requests (response_delay)

### About:
A python function that fetches urls based off a fed in list, and allows users to dynamically wait between successive HTTP requests (I use this when I'm web-scraping and need to be "kind" to the website).

### Getting started:
- Download and install python3.6 from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- pip install requests

### Getting help:
If your are facing any problem please raise an issue.
